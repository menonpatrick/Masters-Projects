**Bus Simulation**

Following parameters were implemented:

> 15 bus stops
> 5 buses
> The time to drive between any two contiguous stops is 5 minutes
> The passenger’s mean arrival rate at each stop is 5 persons/min
> The boarding time is 2seconds for each passenger
> The total simulation time is 8 hours.
