**Bus Simulation**

This was an Individual Project made in Java!

This is a simulation for buses where the number of bus stops is greater than the number of buses.
These initializations are taken from a file.
The buses start from a particular stop and if there is no passenger present at that stop then the bus moves forward to the next stop.
If the bus stop is not empty, every person present at the stop boards the bus and only then the bus moves forward.
The size of the bus is unlimited, i.e it can carry infinite number of passengers.


Following are the initial parameters that were implemented:

* 15 bus stops
* 5 buses
* The time to drive between any two contiguous stops in 5 minutes
* The passenger's mean arrival rate at each stop is 5 persons/minute
* The boarding time 2 seconds per passenger
* The total simulation time is 8 hours
